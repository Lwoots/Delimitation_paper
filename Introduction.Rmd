Multi-locus datasets are increasingly common and affordable, and have been widely used in the evolutionary field. Species delimitation, and is moving the field away from an over reliance on morphology

Species delimitation is widely recognised as a crucial component of systematic biology, with ramifications for many downstream analyses. The recent abundance and affordability of genome-wide, multi-locus datasets have altered the way that species delimitation problems are approached. Greater reliance is being placed on these genetic datasets over the traditional emphasis on morphology, especially as the field focuses on uncovering taxa without discrete morphological variation. In a typical species delimitation study that uses genome-wide data, a single dataset will be created. The dataset will generally fall into too main categories 'sequence capture' and 'Radseq'.

Utility of next gen data for species delimitation

Species delimitation is widely recognised as a crucial component of systematic biology, with ramifications for many downstream analyses. The recent abundance and affordability of genome-wide, multi-locus datasets have provided unprecendented power to circumscribe robust species boundaries, even in the face of traditional difficulties such as few distinctive morphological characteristics, geneflow [@Jackson2017], young species and hybrids.

Multilocus datasets can be classified into two main types, seq capture and Radseq. What they are and their pros and cons. Methods typically used on them.

Problems with only using one type, and how pholygenetics is using both [@Manthey2016; @Obiol2021]. Yet to be properly done in species delimitation yet though.

In phylogentics, the both types of data are starting to be used in order to overcome their weaknesses.


Yet despite the insights provided by these multilocus datasets there are still uncertainties.
